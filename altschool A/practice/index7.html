        <p>Exploitation involves being groomed, forced or coerced into doing something that you don't want to do for someone else's gain.</p>
        <p>What is an example of exploitation?
            A domestic worker or helper is a person who works within their employer's home, performing a variety of tasks. This arrangement becomes exploitative when there are restrictions on the domestic worker's movement, and they are forced to work long hours for little pay. They may also suffer physical and sexual abuse.</p>
            <p>Say no to exploitation. Instead, offer <em>support</em>.</p>
